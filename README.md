# AIcore-Hangman

In this little project I developed a classic game called hangman in Python.

    When you run this python script it will choose a word from the list of word. 
    This game selects any random word from the file and asks you to guess character for that word. You will get chance to guess a word. 
    when you guesses correct character your chance will not be counted when you gives wrong character your chance will be reduced by one.


    Mileston 2:
    For this project, I begin by creating a variable through the formation of a list of potential words. 
    Next, I randomly select a letter from this list and proceed to request a single letter as input. 

    Mileston 3:
    The next step is to validate the guess and check if it matches the chosen word. 
    This entire process can be encapsulated within functions to enhance code readability and understanding.

    Milestone 4:
    In this stage, I employ the object-oriented programming paradigm to construct a comprehensive Hangman game. 
    Initially, we create a class to centralize all the code. Following that, we establish a method prompting the user to guess a letter, alongside another method to verify if the guessed letter is present in the target word, effectively determining its presence or absence.

    Milestone 5:
    Now, the Hangman class is ready, and the game will run using the play_game function. 
    While running some tests, I encountered errors and worked on solving them.
    The code is functioning correctly and is ready to go!!!

    In the final stage, I attempted to optimize my code by making some modifications. 
    The significant change was in the play_game function, where I altered the while condition and reduced the if condition that I had previously utilized.
    I also strived to keep the code organized, ensuring that each object maintains its own specific data separate from others.


    Hope you enjoy this game. Any modification in this game would be highly appreciated.
