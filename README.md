# AIcore-Hangman

In this little project I developed a classic game called hangman in Python.

    When you run this python script it will choose a word from the list of word. 
    This game selects any random word from the file and asks you to guess character for that word. You will get chance to guess a word. 
    when you guesses correct character your chance will not be counted when you gives wrong character your chance will be reduced by one.

    For this project, I begin by creating a variable through the formation of a list of potential words. Next, I randomly select a letter from this list and proceed to request a single letter as input. 

    Hope you enjoy this game. Any modification in this game would be highly appreciated.
